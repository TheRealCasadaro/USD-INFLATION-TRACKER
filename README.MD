Absolutely! Here’s a suggested name and folder structure for your application:

### **Application Name:**

**USD Inflation Tracker**

### **📁 Folder Structure:**

```
USD-Inflation-Tracker/
│── assets/             # Images, icons, and other media assets
│── css/                # Stylesheets for the application
│── js/                 # JavaScript files for functionality
│── data/               # Historical data (JSON/CSV format)
│── components/         # Modular UI components if using frameworks
│── index.html          # Main entry point of the app
│── README.md           # Documentation for project setup & usage
│── package.json        # If using Node.js or front-end frameworks
│── server/             # (Optional) Backend server setup
```

Each folder has a purpose:

- **`assets/`** stores images/icons if needed.
- **`css/`** contains styles for a well-designed UI.
- **`js/`** includes scripts to fetch and display USD value data.
- **`data/`** holds inflation statistics in formats like JSON/CSV.
- **`components/`** is useful if you plan to modularize elements (like React/Vue).
- **`server/`** is optional for back-end needs if pulling real-time data.


### **🚀 Version Control Strategy**

#### **Core Branching Model**

* `main`** (Stable Production)** → Holds the official, stable version of the system.
* `develop`** (Active Development)** → Contains work-in-progress features, updates, and improvements.
* `feature/*`** (New Features)** → Each major addition is developed independently before merging into `develop`.
* `hotfix/*`** (Urgent Fixes)** → Used for emergency patches applied directly to production.
* `release/*`** (Final Testing & Pre-Deployment)** → Ensures stability before moving changes to `main`.
